Building using Scons
====================

To build using Scons, download and install:  
*	[www.python.org](Python 2.6+)
*	[www.scons.org](Scons 2.2+)

This assumes you already have a Java compiler and runtime etc installed.

Then, simply go to the top level directory (where this README's source lives) and type `scons`.

Then, MARVEL! as scons does all the hard work for you.

To clean the directory, type `scons -c`
